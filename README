====================

Welcome to MCBans

Expectations
--------

Please remember the following things while using our plugin!

* MCBans is maintained constantly by a team of staff, but we're not miracle workers! Like everyone, we need time to perform our tasks and can't do everything on demand.
* MCBans isn't always 100% clear from invalid bans - but, we're well on our way. Your help is always thanked in removing invalid bans and we try our hardest to monitor everything.
* MCBans has a small dedicated development team - We do only have a few dedicated developers, but they do have other commitments as well.
* MCBans staff don't always have good memories! Email: support@mcbans.com
